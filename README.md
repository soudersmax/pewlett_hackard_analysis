- The number of people retiring in about 10 years is much smaller than the number retiring this year, indicating that it is unlikely the company will have to handle a loss of this magnitude for a while.

## Summary

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
   - Pewlett-Hackard will need to replace 90,398 employees as the silver tsunami hits
2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
   - The list of mentorship eligible employees only contains 1,549 individuals, so there are more than enough retirement-ready employees to mentor this list of current employees. 

Two additional queries could provide more insight into the company's needs for their response to the the wave of retiring employees

1. A query that displays the salaries of those retiring with those employees who are not yet retirement ready would provide a stepping-stone to incentivizing continued employment or rewarding promotion for those who are staying. This stems from the seemingly "strange" salary table in the original data indicating that many of the retiring employees had not received raises or promotions in many years. 
2. A Query comparing the titles of those leaving with those who are mentorship eligible to display where there are "extra" mentors. This could allow people in different departments to be mentored into new positions that may be outside of their departments but within their interests while still rewarding company loyalty and promoting personal and professional development.
